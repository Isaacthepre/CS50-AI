Requires knowledge to draw conclusions
Uncertainty, this is when it only has a specific probability of confidence on an event.
Optimization, there are multiple ways to solve a problem but what is the best way
Learning : Machine learning, having data means we can learn from it and experience to get better at doing things based on greater access to data
Neural Networks : draws from the logic of the human brain
Language : how can computers understand normal languages such as english

Terminology:
    Agent
        An entity which perceives its environment and acts upon this environment
    State
        A configuration of the agent in ins environment
    Initial State
        The state which the agent begins with / in
    Actions
        Choices that can be made in a state
            Actions(s) returns the set of actions that can be executed in state s
    Transition Model
        A description of what state results from performing any available action
            Result(s, a) returns the state resulting from performing action a in state s
    State Space
        The set of all states reachable from the initial state by any sequence of actions
            Often represented on a graph
    Goal Test
        A way to determine whether a given state is a goal state
    Path Cost
        Numerical cost associated with a given path
    Solution
        The method and path followed to reach the goal
    Optimal Solution
        A solution with teh lowest path cost among all the solutions

        Goal Test
        Path Cost Function
    Node
        A data structure that keeps track of
            A state
            A parent (node that generated this code)
            An action (action applied to parent to get node)
            A path cost (from initial state to node)
                Initial state has no parent
